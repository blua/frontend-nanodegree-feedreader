The Feed Reader Testing Project is part of the **Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree**. I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds and instructed to write effective tests using the [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) testing framework, to ensure that all works as intended and nothing is broken.


## Contribute

As stated above, this project is part of a Udacity Nanodegree, and therefore should be my own work. For that reason, I won't accept any pull requests.
