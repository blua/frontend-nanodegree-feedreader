## The project

The Feed Reader Testing Project is part of the **Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree**. I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds and instructed to write effective tests using the [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) testing framework, to ensure that all works as intended and nothing is broken.

## How to run

To run the feed reader tests, all you need to do is open index.html in a browser and Jasmine will tell you whether the current code passes each of the tests. If the code fails any tests, they'll be marked in red and an error message will be shown, which will serve as a guide for you to detect and fix the problem.

## Resources

The main resource used for this project was Jasmine's documentation, which can be found on [jasmine.github.io](https://jasmine.github.io/).

## Contribute

As stated above, this project is part of a Udacity Nanodegree, and therefore should be my own work. For that reason, I won't accept any pull requests.
